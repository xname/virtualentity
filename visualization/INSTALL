Virtual Entity Fluxus Visualization

Requirements:
- fluxus (Racket version from git, http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/fluxus.git)
- Racket 5+

If you receive the following error message:

default-module-name-resolver: the kernel's resolver works only on `quote' forms; given: '(lib "planet/resolver.rkt")

 === context ===
 standard-module-name-resolver
 /Users/gabor/projects/virtualentity/virtualentity/visualization/mysql/private/auth.rkt: [traversing imports]
 /Users/gabor/projects/virtualentity/virtualentity/visualization/mysql/main.rkt: [traversing imports]

It seems that Racket tries to recompile the modules based on file dates, but it cannot do it from fluxus.
Try to run this command in the visualization directory:
touch -t 201102091007 mysql/private/compiled/auth_ss.zo
