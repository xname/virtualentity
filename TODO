TODO (Virtual Entity Alpha-Minus-Minus  CODENAME ZELJKO - January 2009)

- security problems: ve-db and ve-engine are running in client mode. they will have to be server.
- annotate: must be separated in two: on one side the relations, on the other comments and notes.
- DNA: develop and describe the different types of dna relations between files. 
  Cousin and other more complex relations implementing time will be defined
- cache MD5 for fast retrival (get soul)
- tab completion
- backwarding arrow
- join ve and ve-soul:
			soul create cacca.ogg 		#create Soul cacca.ogg
			soul cacca.ogg 			#display and edit cacca.ogg (soul+aura)
			soul aura cacca.ogg 		#diplay and edit aura cacca.ogg
			soul twinning 			#2 instances with identical Soul (-alias)

- working with url and not only in local directory
- error management
- adding password to open Soul
- explain better and change naming for 'alias': twinning, completion
- remake relations (accrocchio)
- important correction: DNA relations are currently prompted at the end of the editing. 
  this is ok but more important, relations should be also in the aura, 
  where everybody can edit, so password independent.
